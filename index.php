   <h2 class="center-block">Welcome to <em>Top of the Barrel</em>!</h2>

   <div class="center-block">
      <p>Here at <em>Top of the Barrel</em>, we like to make movie watching even <span class="uppercase">more</span> fun than normal!</p>

      <p>How do we do this, you ask?</p>

      <hr />

      <div class="text-center center-block icon"><i class="fa fa-film"></i></div>

      <h3>1: Watch a Movie</h3>

      <p>Simply start by watching any movie that you haven't watched yet for the game. It's that easy!</p>

      <hr />

      <div class="text-center center-block icon"><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i></div>

      <h3>2: Add to Watched List</h3>

      <p>Once you've finished the movie successfully (<a id="egg">*</a>), visit the "<a href="movie.php">Add a Movie</a>" page to add it to your list of watched movies.</p>

      <h3>3: Enjoy the Rewards</h3>

      <p>While you'll no doubt enjoy reaping the point rewards for every movie you watch, the <span class="uppercase">real</span> prizes come from the hidden badges!</p>

      <h4>But what <span class="uppercase">are</span> badges, you ask?</h4>

      <p>Badges are special prizes you receive when you complete special tasks, such as being the first person to watch a particular movie, or sitting through an especially bad one.</p>

      <p>However, the badges you have the potential to earn can not be found anywhere. Your only hope is to sit on your couch, relax, and start watching as many movies as you can!</p>
